THIS IS JUST A GENERAL GUIDELINE FOR THE USE OF CompCert clightgen.

Users of VST may need to use the CompCert "clightgen" tool to parse
and type-check their C programs into a .v file that represents the
program in Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of the CompCert Clight language.

That is:   clightgen -normalize foo.c    produces the file foo.v containing ASTs.

CompCert clightgen is not open-source.  You need a license to use it.

If you are using VST with predigested C programs, on which
someone else has already run clightgen to produce the AST files,
then you don't need to use clightgen at all, and you don't need a license.

If you are an academic user (at a university) using clightgen
for academic or research purposes, then the INRIA CompCert license
permits you to use clightgen (and the rest of CompCert) for free.

If you are not an academic user, and your use is "educational, research, personal,
or evaluation" then you may use CompCert for free under the INRIA CompCert license.

"Any other use is commercial use" according to the INRIA CompCert license.
 You can obtain a CompCert license from AbsInt.com:
https://www.absint.com/ai_eval.pdf

If your commercial use is to produce open-source 
proofs of open-source software, then the cost may be very
small, perhaps as low as zero.  But you still have to fill
out the ai_eval.pdf web form to explain yourself and your purpose.

If you are a commercial user, and you want a clightgen license for
making a commercial product, you can get a free 30-day evaluation
license from AbsInt.com (time limit can be extended upon request), but
eventually you will need to pay.  AbsInt sells the CompCert
clightgen-only license for approximately 15% of the cost of a full
CompCert license.  Depending on the size of your product development
group, the cost may be as low as 3000 Euros.  Fill out the ai_eval.pdf
form and ask about it.
