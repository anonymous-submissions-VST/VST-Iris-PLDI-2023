Verified Software Toolchain copyright 2007-2022 by Andrew W. Appel,

All parts of the VST opam distribution, (make target "vst"),
(including msl, sepcomp, veric, floyd, concurrency) and the VST test suite
(including progs, progs64, sha, hmacdrbg, hmacfcf, aes) are
licensed by the BSD 2-clause license (below).

The github repo contains certain subdirectories, not distributed
in the opam package, that are licensed differently:

- The "compcert" subdirectory is Copyright (c) 2004-2013 by INRIA,
and licensed according to the terms in "compcert/LICENSE";
basically, those files are dual licensed with a proprietary license
and an open-source license.

- The "compcert_new" subdirectory is Copyright (c) 2004-2013 by INRIA,
and contains some files that are not dual-licensed; therefore you should
not use compcert_new unless you satisfy the terms of the CompCert license.

- The hub submodules (including fcf, InteractionTrees, paco, etc.)
are licensed by the terms of their own LICENSE files,
and are not part of the VST opam distribution.
