This folder contains a local opam repository used ONLY for the purpose of allowing VST's continuous
integration script (in .github/workflows/coq-action.yml) to use pre-release or patched versions
of CompCert or other opam packages. This is usually a transitional situation, so in most commits
you will find that the packages/ directory is empty except for the .dummy placeholder.
For a nonempty example, see commit f113a54.
